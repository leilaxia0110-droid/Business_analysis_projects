This project builds machine learning models to predict customer churn.
## Models
Logistic Regression (baseline)
K-Nearest Neighbors
Random Forest
## Evaluation
Models are evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.
Random Forest achieved the best overall performance after hyperparameter tuning.
## Output
ROC curve comparison
Saved best model
