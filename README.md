# Customer Churn Prediction
This project builds machine learning models to predict customer churn.
## Models
Logistic Regression (baseline)
K-Nearest Neighbors
Random Forest
## Evaluation
Models are evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.
Random Forest achieved the best overall performance after hyperparameter tuning.
## Output
ROC curve comparison
Saved best model

## Credit Risk Analysis
Loan default prediction using machine learning.
### Techniques
Logistic Regression & Random Forest
Class imbalance handling with SMOTE
Feature scaling & one-hot encoding via Pipelines
ROC-AUC as primary evaluation metric
### Run
```bash
python credit_risk_analysis.py
# credit_risk_analysis.py
"""
Credit Risk Analysis - Loan Default Prediction
"""

## Fraud Detection (Anomaly Detection)
This project builds a simple fraud detection system using:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
SMOTE for class imbalance
### Key Techniques
Feature scaling & one-hot encoding
Imbalanced classification handling
ROC-AUC evaluation
